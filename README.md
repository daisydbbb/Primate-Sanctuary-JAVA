# Primate Sanctuary System App üêµ

This Java application is designed to assist with the management and registration of primates at a primate sanctuary. It supports various functions, including registration, moving, sickness treatment etc.

## Description

The Primate Sanctuary System app facilitates the management of two types of primate housing:
- **Isolation Cages:** There are 20 individual cages for new arrivals and those that are sick and need medical attention.
- **Enclosures:** Larger areas that can accommodate a troop of monkeys from the same species.

## Key Features

- **Registration of New Monkeys:** Allows users to register new monkeys directly into isolation.
- **Notifications:** Alert users when the action has issue and can not be performed. E.g. when isolation cages are full and no further monkeys can be accommodated.
- **Monkey Transfers:** Enables users to move monkeys from isolation cages to the appropriate enclosures when they are healthy.
- **Enclosure Lists:** Generates detailed lists for each enclosure showing the monkeys housed, including their name, sex, favorite food, enclosure type and healthy status.
- **All Primates Lists:** Generates the list that includes all the primates in the sanctuary, including isolation cages and enclosures.
- **Alphabetical Order:** All monkeys housed in the sanctuary are listed in alphabetical order.
