# Primate Sanctuary System App üêµ

This Java application is designed to assist with the management and registration of primates at a primate sanctuary. It supports various functions, including registration, moving, sickness treatment etc.

## Description

The Primate Sanctuary System app facilitates the management of two types of primate housing:
- **Isolation Cages:** For new arrivals and those receiving medical attention, ensuring individual housing.
- **Enclosures:** Larger areas that can accommodate a troop of monkeys from the same species.

## Features

- **Registration of New Monkeys:** Allows users to register new monkeys directly into isolation.
- **Capacity Notifications:** Notifies users when isolation cages are full and no further monkeys can be accommodated.
- **Monkey Transfers:** Enables users to move monkeys from isolation to the appropriate enclosures after receiving medical care.
- **Enclosure Lists:** Generates detailed lists for each enclosure showing the monkeys housed, including their name, sex, and favorite food.
- **Alphabetical Monkey List:** Produces an alphabetical list of all monkeys housed in the sanctuary.
